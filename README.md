01. Intro to blockchain

- What is a transaction? - every transfer of value or execution of a smart contract that writes up something to the blockchain and changing the status of the blockchain is considered a transaction
- What is the approximate time of every Ethereum transaction? - from 15 seconds to 10/15 minutes
- What is a node? - each computer that runs a specific software that verifies and combines transactions


02. Learning Solidity

- What is delegatecall? - Delegate call executes code in another contract using the context of the contract that called it
- What is multicall? - Multi call aggregates all queries to (different) contracts in one call, it also aggregates the results into a single one. It is used to gather synchronized data from the blockchain because it ensures that the data is retrieved from the same block.
- What is time lock? - Time lock is an approach to delay a transaction. It gives the user time to react before the transaction is submitted if he discovers that there is a malicious act.
